# Team Contract

---
## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

Discord will be the main platform we use for communication outside of class, when required for work on your course project.

Respond to messages ASAP. Obviously everyone is busy with schoolwork and/or their own life but be present in the groupchat. 

Teammates will notify others in cases that they will not be able to meet deadlines, will have to miss lecture/tutorial, or find a dank meme.

* Respectful and inclusive behaviour are necessary for smooth and productive communication.
* Respectfully listening to each teammate. Let everyone finish then chime in. 
* Every group member is allowed to disagree. Never shut an idea down without thinking about it. 
* Communicate blockers and progress. Let the rest of the group what you're up to. 
* If someone don't tell the rest of the group they are struggling with something no one else can help you. 

---

## Decision Making

* We shall exercise our democratic power. Vote!

---

## Conflict resolution

* First try to resolve the conflict ourselves by trying to reach a compromise. If it doesn't work then we shall go to a TA or professor. 

---

## Accountability

* Complete your assigned section of work. 
* If you require assistance let the rest of the group know.
* Follow the guidelines set in communications, decision making, and conflict resolution section of the contract.
